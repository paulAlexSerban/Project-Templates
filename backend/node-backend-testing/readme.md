## Node.js Test Runner

Node.js now has its own inbuilt test runner thatâ€™s been stable since v18. However, it is still in experimental mode, so it is likely to change over time.

The test runner is called `npm run test` and it will run all the tests in the `test` directory. It will also run any files that end in `.test.js` or `.spec.js`.
